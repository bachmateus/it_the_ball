# it_the_ball
A Tamagochi challenge project

It the ball is a project that I started to develop as a Devs chalenge with my friends.

This challenge has some states requirements that are:

- Normal
- Hungry
- Sick
- Sleeping
- Dead

Each developer could select the engine and language to work with. I decided to develop with React Native just to know how to work with Animated things.

Project started at 2020 february 29 and must end at 20020 march 20.

Wish me luck srsrsrsrsr.

Updating

I almost got it heheheheh

I didn't implement notifications and my app didn't run in background but I made a way to get it working. I save the last active animation and when the player returns to the game it is checked and based in the time out of the game I trigger the animation and change the status bar.
